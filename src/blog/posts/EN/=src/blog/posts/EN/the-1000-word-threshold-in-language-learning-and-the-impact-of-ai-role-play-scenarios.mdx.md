    "introduction": "Language learning is a critical skill that enables individuals to express themselves and interact with other cultures. In this process, vocabulary breadth plays a significant role. Particularly, the 1,000-word threshold forms the fundamental building blocks of a language and enhances communication abilities. In this article, we will examine this threshold along with the impact of AI-supported role-play scenarios on language acquisition.",
    "the_1000_word_threshold": {
      "definition": "The 1,000-word threshold refers to the minimum number of words needed to establish basic communication in a language. This benchmark allows learners to express themselves in common everyday situations. Research indicates that individuals who surpass this threshold develop their language skills more rapidly.",
      "importance_of_vocabulary": "Vocabulary is a key factor in language use. Those with adequate vocabulary knowledge can communicate more fluently and effectively. Especially for beginners, establishing a foundation of 1,000 words significantly facilitates progression to advanced levels."
