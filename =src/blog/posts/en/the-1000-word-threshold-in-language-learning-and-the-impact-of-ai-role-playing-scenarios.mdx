    "Introduction": "Language learning is a critical process for individuals to enhance their communication skills. However, one of the greatest challenges in this journey is acquiring a sufficient vocabulary. Research indicates that the 1,000-word threshold represents a significant milestone in language acquisition. In this article, we will examine this threshold alongside the impact of AI-supported role-playing scenarios.",
    "What Is the 1,000-Word Threshold?": "The 1,000-word threshold refers to the minimum number of words required to establish basic communication in a language. This milestone plays a crucial role in developing speaking, writing, and listening skills. When learners acquire these words, they gain the ability to handle everyday situations effectively.",
    "Artificial Intelligence and Role-Playing Scenarios": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary tool in language education. AI-based applications offer role-playing scenarios that help users enhance their language skills. These scenarios simulate real-life situations that learners may encounter, providing valuable practice opportunities.",
    "The Importance of Role-Playing": "Role-playing scenarios not only improve language skills but also build learners' confidence. Through realistic simulations, learners can:  \n- **Develop Communication Skills:** Learn how to interact appropriately in various contexts.  \n- **Gain Cultural Awareness:** Explore the communication styles of different cultures.  \n- **Overcome Fear of Making Mistakes:** Understand that errors are a natural part of the learning process in a safe environment.",
    "Language Learning Experience with Talkparty": "Talkparty.app offers students an interactive and enjoyable language learning experience. Thanks to AI-powered role-playing scenarios, users can practice their language skills in realistic contexts. Moreover, the customizable scenarios provided by Talkparty can be tailored to meet each learner’s individual needs.",
    "Limitations of Other Applications": "Some popular language learning apps do not adequately focus on vocabulary development. These apps often emphasize word repetition and grammar rules but fall short in offering sufficient opportunities to develop real-life communication skills. Talkparty addresses this gap by delivering a more interactive and practical experience to its users.",
    "Educational Technologies and Language Development": "Educational technologies play a vital role in language learning. With AI-based applications, students can:  \n- **Learn at Their Own Pace:** Progress through lessons tailored to their individual speed.  \n- **Receive Feedback:** Correct mistakes with immediate feedback.  \n- **Boost Motivation:** Enjoy a more engaging learning process through gamified content.",
    "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)": {
      "Q1": "Why is the 1,000-word threshold important?",
      "A1": "This threshold represents the minimum vocabulary needed for basic communication and is critical in the early stages of language learning.",
      "Q2": "How do AI-powered role-playing scenarios work?",
