    "introduction": "Language acquisition requires individuals to possess a certain vocabulary to effectively use a new language. Research indicates that knowing around 1,000 words is sufficient to attain fluency. This threshold is crucial for learners to develop fundamental communication skills. Additionally, AI-supported role-play scenarios make language practice more interactive and efficient.",
    "the_1000_word_threshold": {
      "definition": "The 1,000-word threshold refers to the number of words necessary to engage in basic communication in a language. These words typically include frequently used terms in daily life. Reaching this threshold enables language learners to express themselves, form simple sentences, and conduct basic conversations.",
      "vocabulary_and_communication": "Vocabulary is a cornerstone of communication in any language. Having adequate vocabulary knowledge allows individuals to clearly articulate their thoughts and communicate effectively with others. For instance, a learner who attains a 1,000-word lexicon can comfortably handle daily conversations such as greetings, introductions, and asking for directions."
